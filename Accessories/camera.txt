The 2 major camera types are DSLR camera and Mirrorless camera.

1.DSLR Camera:
    A DSLR camera uses a mirror and optical viewfinder system to direct light to the camera's sensor. When you take a photo, the mirror flips up, momentarily blocking the viewfinder, allowing light to reach the sensor. DSLRs tend to be larger and heavier due to their internal mirror mechanism.
The most efficient model in DSLR is Canon's EOS 5D mark 4.

2.Mirrorless Camera:
    A mirrorless camera, as the name suggests, lacks the mirror found in DSLRs. Light directly hits the camera's image sensor, and an electronic viewfinder (EVF) or the camera's LCD screen is used for composing shots. Mirrorless cameras are typically smaller and lighter than DSLRs, making them more portable and suitable for various photography styles.
